# Getting Started with Java Chat Application

This java project is of chatting between client & server.

In the project there are two files Server.java and Client.java.

# Server.java
This file handles the creation of server, connecting with client, and sending and receiving of messages from clients.
The file contains two function reading and writing to read and write.
